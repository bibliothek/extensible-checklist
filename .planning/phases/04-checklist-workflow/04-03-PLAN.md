  <what-built>
Complete checklist workflow system spanning:
- Checklist management API (list, delete, item operations)
- Checklist list page with progress indicators
- Checklist working page with full interaction capabilities
- All CHKL requirements (CHKL-01 through CHKL-08)

**Prerequisites:**
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Log in to application
3. Ensure you have at least 2-3 templates created (with some overlapping items for merge testing)

**Test Sequence:**

**1. Checklist List View (CHKL-01, CHKL-08)**
- Visit http://localhost:3000/checklists
- Verify page loads without errors
- If no checklists: verify empty state shows with "Create from Templates" button
- Create 2-3 checklists via /checklists/new (select different template combinations)
- Return to /checklists
- Expected results:
  - [ ] All created checklists appear in list
  - [ ] Most recent checklist is at top (sorted by date)
  - [ ] Each shows name, progress (0/N items), progress bar, created date
  - [ ] Each has clickable name link and delete button
- Test delete:
  - [ ] Click delete button, confirm dialog appears
  - [ ] Confirm deletion, checklist removed from list
  - [ ] Page doesn't crash, remaining checklists still visible

  - [ ] Multiple groups can be collapsed independently
  - [ ] If checklist has "Custom" items (added after creation), they appear in separate group

**4. Complete Items (CHKL-03, CHKL-04)**
- Check off several items:
  - [ ] Click checkbox next to item
  - [ ] Item marked complete instantly (optimistic UI)
  - [ ] Progress updates immediately ("4 of 10 items completed")
  - [ ] Progress bar visually updates
  - [ ] Refresh page, completion state persists
- Uncheck items:
  - [ ] Click checked checkbox
  - [ ] Item marked incomplete instantly
  - [ ] Progress decreases accordingly
  - [ ] Changes persist after refresh

**5. Add New Items (CHKL-05)**
- Scroll to bottom of checklist:

  - [ ] Click up arrow on second item - swaps back
  - [ ] Items reorder instantly (optimistic UI)
  - [ ] Refresh page, order persists
  - [ ] Reorder items at top/bottom of group (edge cases)
