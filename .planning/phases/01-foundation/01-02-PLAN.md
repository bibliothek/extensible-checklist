  <what-built>
Next.js foundation with:
- Next.js 14+ with TypeScript and App Router
- Prisma ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Database client utility
- Landing page with project branding
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

3. Verify you see:
   - "Extensible Checklist" heading (large, bold)
   - "Fast, frictionless checklist instantiation" description
   - Page is centered vertically and horizontally
   - Tailwind styling is applied (clean, modern look)

4. Check browser console (F12) - should be no errors

5. In your terminal, run:
   ```bash
   npx prisma validate
   ```
   Should output "The schema is valid"

6. Run build check:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Should complete without errors

7. Verify file structure:
   ```bash
   ls app/          # Should show layout.tsx, page.tsx, globals.css
   ls prisma/       # Should show schema.prisma
   ls lib/          # Should show db.ts
   ```

Expected state:
- Development server runs on port 3000
- Landing page loads and looks professional
- No console errors
- Prisma schema validates
- Project builds successfully
  </how-to-verify>
