## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| PostgreSQL to SQLite data migration | Fresh start acceptable, no production data to migrate |
| Multi-instance deployment | Single instance model for SQLite simplicity |
| Database clustering/replication | Not needed for single-user workflows |
| Connection pooling | SQLite file-based, no connection pool needed |

## Traceability
