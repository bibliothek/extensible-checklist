# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-27
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 13

## Overview

Build a web application for managing personal recurring tasks through reusable checklist templates. Starting with project foundation, we layer authentication, template creation and merging, then complete checklist workflow management. Each phase delivers working capabilities that build toward the core value of fast, frictionless checklist instantiation.

  3. Basic UI framework renders pages
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Set up Next.js, Prisma, and Tailwind foundation
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Verify development environment works end-to-end

**Completed:** 2026-01-26

### Phase 2: Authentication

  1. User can create template with multiple checklist items
  2. User can edit existing template (add, remove, reorder items)
  3. User can delete template from library
  4. User can view all templates in their library
  5. User can select multiple templates and create merged checklist
  6. Merged checklist contains all items from selected templates
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Database schema and template CRUD API foundation
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Template library UI with create, edit, and delete
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Checklist instantiation with merge logic and deduplication
- [x] 03-04-PLAN.md — Verify complete template system end-to-end

**Completed:** 2026-01-26

### Phase 4: Checklist Workflow

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Next.js 16 with App Router and TypeScript for modern React patterns
- Auth.js v5 with JWT sessions for stateless authentication
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL for type-safe database access
- Tailwind CSS v4 for utility-first styling
- Docker Compose for local development database
- Case-sensitive deduplication for template merging
- Optimistic UI updates for responsive feel
- Dark mode support throughout application

**Issues Resolved:**

- Dark mode white backgrounds fixed with proper Tailwind classes
- Add item state management fixed with functional setState
- Post-creation redirect improved to land on working page
- Invalid Tailwind color classes corrected

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- No automated verification system (human checkpoints only)
- No error tracking or logging infrastructure
- No automated testing suite
