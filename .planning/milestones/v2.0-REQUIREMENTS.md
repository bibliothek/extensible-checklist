## Future Requirements

Features deferred to later milestones.

(None yet - v2.0 focused on polish and deployment)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from this milestone. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Run tests in CI/CD | No test suite exists yet - focus on deployment infrastructure first |
| Manual approval gates | Auto-deploy on main for rapid iteration - can add approval later if needed |
| Multiple environments | Single production environment sufficient for v2.0 |
| Monitoring/observability | Basic health check adequate, comprehensive monitoring deferred |
| Database backup automation | Manual backups acceptable for v2.0 |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| UX-01 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| UX-02 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| UX-03 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| UX-04 | Phase 5 | Complete |
