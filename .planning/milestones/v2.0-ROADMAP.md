# Milestone v2.0: Production Ready

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-27
**Phases:** 5-7
**Total Plans:** 7

## Overview

Polish UX for power users and prepare for production deployment. This milestone built on the v1.0 MVP foundation to add power user features (bulk text editing, print view), focus features (hide completed toggle), and complete production deployment infrastructure (Docker, CI/CD, Azure).

## Phases

### Phase 5: Power User UX

**Goal**: Users can edit templates faster and print checklists
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (v1.0 complete)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 05-01: Bulk text mode for templates
- [x] 05-02: Print view for checklists
- [x] 05-03: Verify power user UX features

**Details:**

Delivered toggle-based bulk text editing for rapid template creation. Users can switch between individual item mode and multi-line text paste mode. Print view provides ultra-minimal black & white formatting (8pt font, 9pt headers) optimized for maximum information density on paper. Template grouping is preserved in print output. Both features were human-verified and iterated based on real user testing.

**Key decisions:**
- Mode toggle pattern with bidirectional data synchronization
- Ultra-minimal print styling prioritizing density over visual design
- Checkpoint verification with iterative refinement

### Phase 6: Checklist Focus

**Goal**: Users can hide completed work to focus on remaining tasks
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 06-01: Hide completed toggle with per-checklist persistence

**Details:**

Implemented per-checklist preference to hide completed items. When enabled, checked items disappear from view and template groups with all items completed are hidden entirely. Preference is stored in database and persists across sessions. Client-side filtering enables instant optimistic updates. Progress calculations use all items regardless of filter state.

**Key decisions:**
- Per-resource preferences instead of user-wide settings
- Client-side filtering for instant feedback
- Hide entire groups when all items complete

### Phase 7: Production Deployment

**Goal**: Application runs in Docker and auto-deploys to Azure
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 07-01: Docker foundation with multi-stage build and migrations
- [x] 07-02: Local Docker development and health check endpoint
- [x] 07-03: Azure CI/CD pipeline and deployment documentation

**Details:**

Created complete production deployment infrastructure. Multi-stage Docker build using node:20-alpine optimizes image size. Prisma migrations run automatically on container startup. Docker Compose provides local development environment with app + postgres services. Health check endpoint (/api/health) verifies database connectivity. GitHub Actions workflow builds Docker image on push to main, pushes to Azure Container Registry, and deploys to Azure App Service with automated health verification. Comprehensive README documentation includes Azure CLI commands for reproducible infrastructure setup.

**Key decisions:**
- Standalone Next.js output for optimized Docker deployment
- Automated migrations at container startup
- Auto-deploy on main without manual approval gates
- Dual image tagging (commit SHA + latest)
- Health verification with retry logic

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Mode toggle pattern: Bidirectional data sync when switching between editing modes (05-01)
- Ultra-minimal print styling: 8pt font, 9pt bold headers, 1px spacing for maximum density (05-02, 05-03)
- Per-resource preferences: Store UI state per checklist, not user-wide (06-01)
- Client-side filtering: Apply display filters in React for instant optimistic updates (06-01)
- Standalone Next.js output: Enable output: 'standalone' for Docker deployment (07-01)
- Automated migrations: Run Prisma migrations before app starts in containers (07-01)
- Auto-deploy on main: No manual approval gate for continuous delivery (07-03)
- Dual image tagging: Tag with commit SHA and 'latest' for versioning and rollback (07-03)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Print view density: Iterated styling twice during verification to achieve ultra-minimal appearance (05-03)
- Node version mismatch: Switched from Node 16 to Node 20 for Next.js compatibility (05-01)
- Prisma client regeneration: Added explicit generate step after schema changes (06-01)
- Docker healthcheck: Added wget to alpine image for healthcheck support (07-02)

**Issues Deferred:**

None - all planned features completed and verified.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- No test suite yet: CI/CD pipeline doesn't run tests (deferred to future milestone)
- Manual database backups: No automated backup solution (acceptable for v2.0)
- Single environment: No staging environment (auto-deploy to production only)
- Basic monitoring: Health check only, no comprehensive observability (deferred)
